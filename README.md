# Museum Hub

museumHub aims to bridge the gap between vast public domain art repositories and the people who seek to discover, study, and be inspired by them. We're building an open-source platform that collates, organizes, and makes searchable artwork from public domain databases worldwide, creating a unified interface for art exploration.

The Stacks - a framework for museum hub that is reusable, allowing this process/architecture to be used for other public domain databases. Like trains. or weather. or whatever it is you love.
